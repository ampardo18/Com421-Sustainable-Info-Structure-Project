      <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>

      In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column.</p>

         <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
         <li>The first variable (in column A) is a <Strong class="colored-bold-text">unique identifier. </Strong></li>
         <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change <em>4tutorial_types to tutorial_types.</em></li>
         <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change <em> use </em> and <em>useful </em> to <em>perc_ease_of_use and perc_usefulness</em>, respectively.</li>
         <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F refers to <em> Perceived
         Usefulness </em> and Column G refers to <em>Perceived Ease of Use. </em></li>

         <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In <em>gender</em>, change the "female" value to "F".</li>
         <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns. For example, <em>tasks_completed</em> values (Y/Y/N) 
         can be broken up into three components. So, add columns <em>task1</em>, <em>task2</em>, and <em>task3</em>, and reformat values appropriately.</li>
         <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old <em>tasks_completed</em> column.</li>

         <p>Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics

         <p>Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, perc_enjoy is much higher on
